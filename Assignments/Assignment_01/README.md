# Assignment 01

## Brief

Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to customize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

## Project description

This is a simple to-do list creator. There’s really not much to it and is very self-explanatory. The feature I’m more proud of is when you select a color, the background color of the input box changes so to show how the card or list element will look once “ + “ is pressed.

## Function list

I haven't used functions.
